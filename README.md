The K-Tree Clustering Software
==============================

The K-Tree clustering software is a collection k-tree related clustering libaries and programs. It was forked from [LMW-tree](https://github.com/cmdevries/LMW-tree) which was originally developed by Chris de Vries and Lance De Vine at ![QUT](http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/graphics/logo.gif) (Queensland University of Technolog). 

After seeing its the powerful ability in clustering big data, it was utilised to cluster satellite images to help with solving environment related problems.
