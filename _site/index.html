<p>The K-Tree clustering software is a collection k-tree related clustering libaries and programs. It was forked from <a href="https://github.com/cmdevries/LMW-tree">LMW-tree</a> which was originally developed by Chris de Vries and Lance De Vine at QUT (Queensland University of Technology).</p>

<p>After seeing its the powerful ability in clustering big data, it was utilised to cluster satellite images to help with solving environment related problems.</p>
