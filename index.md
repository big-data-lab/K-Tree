The K-Tree clustering software is a collection k-tree related clustering libaries and programs. It was forked from [LMW-tree](https://github.com/cmdevries/LMW-tree) which was originally developed by Chris de Vries and Lance De Vine at QUT (Queensland University of Technology). 

After seeing its the powerful ability in clustering big data, it was utilised to cluster satellite images to help with solving environment related problems.

Currently, this repository is maintained by Eric Tang ([@DrEricTang](https://twitter.com/DrEricTang)).
