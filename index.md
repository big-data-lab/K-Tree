The K-Tree clustering software is a collection [K-tree](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16976/1/k-tree.pdf) related clustering libraries and programs. It was derived and forked from [LMW-tree](https://github.com/cmdevries/LMW-tree) which was developed by Chris de Vries and Lance De Vine at [QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au) (Queensland University of Technology). Please refer to the original [K-tree Website @sf.net](http://ktree.sf.net) for more information such as K-tree algorithm and its related publications.

After seeing its the powerful ability in clustering big data, it can utilised to cluster satellite images to help with solving environment related problems. So we have developed an image clustering tool to assist labeling earth surface such as vegetation, forest, farm land etc. The tool is particularly tested    

Below are the detailed information regarding compiling and using this software:
