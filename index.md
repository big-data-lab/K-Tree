title: K-Tree Clustering

The K-Tree clustering software is a collection [K-tree](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16976/1/k-tree.pdf) related clustering libraries and programs. It was derived and forked from [LMW-tree](https://github.com/cmdevries/LMW-tree) which was developed by Chris de Vries and Lance De Vine at [QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au) (Queensland University of Technology). For K-tree algorithm and its related publications, please refer to the original [K-tree Website@sf.net](http://ktree.sf.net) for more information.

After seeing its powerful ability in clustering big data when it was used in the research work on [ClueWeb data](http://www.lemurproject.org/clueweb12.php/), it is now further utilised to cluster satellite images to help with solving environment related problems. So we have developed an image clustering tool to assist classifying earth surface such as vegetation, forest, farm land, salt lake etc. 

####Salt Lake

With the help and support from environmental scientists and government agencies, there are other possibilities we can also look at:

1.     Crop type and yield classification
2.     Land cover change monitoring
3.     Classifying gullies in the landscape
4.     Others
